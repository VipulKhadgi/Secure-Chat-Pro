# Secure-Chat-Pro
This project is a web-based Artificial Intelligence powered chat application designed for industrial and organizational communication. It functions as a secure internal messaging platform similar to WhatsApp, supporting one-to-one and group chats for seamless collaboration. The core feature of the system is AI-based real-time text summarization, which analyzes ongoing conversations, extracts meaningful insights, and generates concise summaries highlighting key points, decisions, and important updates. This helps users quickly understand long discussions without scrolling through entire chat histories. By reducing information overload and improving clarity, the platform enhances productivity, time efficiency, and decision-making, transforming traditional chat systems into intelligent, enterprise-focused communication tools.
